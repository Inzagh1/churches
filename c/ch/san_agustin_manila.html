                    <ol>Year Built: 1571</ol>
                    <ol>Located: Intramuros, Manila</ol>

                    <p>In Manila's ancient walled city of Intramuros, San Agustin Church—also known as the Archdiocesan Shrine of Our Lady of Consolation and the Church of the Immaculate Conception Parish—is a Roman Catholic church run by the Order of St.
                        Augustine. The San Agustin Church is regarded as the oldest and longest-standing church in the nation. It was constructed between 1587 and 1606. During World War II, the church was the sole building in Intramuros that was still
                        standing. Both man-made and natural disasters required the San Agustin church to be rebuilt three times. It has since endured natural disasters and grown to be the Philippines' oldest church. San Agustin Church in Manila, Philippines,
                        served as a location for Americans and Spaniards to negotiate and sign the surrender of Manila to the Americans in 1898. The St. Augustine Church in Manila was converted by the Japanese forces into a prisoner-concentration camp
                        during World War II.
