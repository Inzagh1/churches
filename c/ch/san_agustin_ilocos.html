                    <h3>“San Agustin Church in Ilocos”</h3>
                    <ol>"Paoay Church"</ol>
                    <ol>Year Built: 1710</ol>
                    <ol>Located: Marcos Ave. Paoay, Ilocos Norte</ol>
                    <ol>Architectural Styles: Baroque Architecture</ol>
                    <p>The most notable example of earthquake baroque architecture in the Philippines is seen at Paoay Church. With its lovely baroque architecture, it transports you to the Spanish colonial era in the Philippine Islands. This magnificent
                        national cultural treasure, which is more than three decades old, has certainly stood the test of time. The 17th century marked the beginning of Paoay Church history. What began as a drawing by Paoay Church became a reality.It
                        was finally inaugurated in 1896. However, in 1927 and 1706, it was damage by earthquakes. Its scars just made it more attractive and worthwhile to visit. San Agustin Church Paoay was named a National Cultural Treasure by the Philippine
                        government in 1973 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site among the nation's baroque churches in 1993 because of its historical and cultural value.
